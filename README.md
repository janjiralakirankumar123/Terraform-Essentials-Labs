To begin with Lab-1, Login to AWS Console.
## Lab-1: Creating an EC2 Instance in AWS and Installing Terraform

#### Task 1: Installing Terraform on Ubuntu 20.04 operating system

* Launch a **t2.micro** instance with OS version as **Ubuntu 20.04** in North Virginia (us-east-1) Region.
* Use tag "**Name:Terraform-Server**"
* In security groups, include ports **22** and **80**. 
* login with username as "ubuntu".

After EC2 is ready:
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname terraform
```
* Hostname will appear if you exit and login again. Or 
* You can type 'bash' and open another shell
```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install wget unzip -y
```
```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.5.5/terraform_1.5.4_linux_amd64.zip
```
```
unzip terraform_1.5.5_linux_amd64.zip
```
```
ls
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
```
```
ls
terraform
```
```
terraform -v
```

#### Task 2: Install Required Packages and login to Ubuntu server using Credentials. 
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
```
```
sudo pip3 install awscli
```
```
aws configure
```
* When it prompts for Credentials, Enter the Keys as example shown below
  
| **Access Key ID.** | **Secret Access Key ID.** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE | wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY |
##### Note: If not available generate Credentials from AWS IAM Service
Once LoggedIn check the account access
```
aws s3 ls
```
```
aws iam list-users
```
#### Task-2.1: Now we are ready to perform the labs
* create directory as Lab1
* create local file
```
mkdir Lab1 && cd Lab1
```
```
vi local.tf
```
```

  filename = "/home/ubuntu/test.txt"
  content  = "wel come to terraform"
}
```
```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
```
terraform destroy
```
#### Task 3: Launching your first AWS EC2 instance using Terraform 
```
cd ~
```
```
mkdir terraform-labs && cd terraform-labs/

## Lab 4 : Remote State using Amazon Simple Storage Service 

#### Task 1: Create a S3 Bucket using AWS Console 

* Create a new S3 bucket in "**us-east-2**" Region by name: "**yourname-terraform**".
* Select "**ACLs enabled**".
* Uncheck "**block public access**" and select "**I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public**".
* "**Enable versioning**".

To cross Check whether the Bucket is created or not, run the below command in CLI.
```
aws s3 ls 
```
#### Task 2: Configure Remote State
```
cd /home/ubuntu/terraform-labs/
```
```
wget https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/files.cloudthat.training/devops/terraform-essentials/remote_state_lab.tar.gz
```

```
```
cat vars.tf
```
```
cat provider.tf
```
Create a File for storing "**terraform.tfstate**" file in backend. ie.. **Amazon S3.** 

```
vi backend.tf
```
Add the given lines, by pressing "INSERT" 
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "<Replace your s3 bucket name>"
    key    = "terraform/remotestate"
  }
}
```
Save the file using "ESCAPE + :wq!"
```
cat backend.tf
```
```
terraform init
```
When it prompts for Region confirmation, enter the same Region in which bucket is created.
```
us-east-2
```
```
terraform fmt
```
```
terraform validate
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply
```
* Go to the S3 bucket and open **terraform** > **remotestate** > In Properties Copy the **Object URL** and paste it in Browser.
  (By default it shows Access Denied)
* To view, Click on permission and click on **Edit** under **Access control list (ACL)** > **Everyone (public access)** > Check "Read" then check **I understand the effects of these changes on this object** and then Click on Save changes
* Copy the **object URL** and paste it into the web browser (If already done, just Refresh the page).
* Now, You should be able to access the state file and View the resources.
  (It shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform state of **aws_instance.terraform-remoteState**.)

Use the "terraform destroy" command for cleaning the infrastructure used in this lab, 
```
terraform destroy
```
```
cd ..
```
* remove the directory using "**rm -rf**"
```
rm -rf remote-state-lab

}

resource "aws_iam_user_group_membership" "example_membership" {
  for_each = aws_iam_user.example_user

  user   = each.value.name
  groups = [aws_iam_group.example_group.name]
}

```

```
## Lab 10 : Creating AWS resources using terraform modules
```
cd /home/ubuntu/
```
```
sudo apt install tree -y
```
```
wget https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/files.cloudthat.training/devops/terraform-essentials/terraform-modules.tar.gz
```
```
tar -xvf terraform-modules.tar.gz
```
```
cd terraform-modules
```
```
tree
```
Cat all files to see the module structure
```
vi main.tf
```
Add the below code after block **module "my_security_group"**
```
output "secgrpid" {
  description = "Newly created sec grp"
  value       = module.my_security_group.sgid
}
```
```
cat provider.tf
```
No change needed
```
vi variables.tf 
```
**Note:**

Replace the **VPC ID** & **Subnet ID** from **ca-central-1** region in **variable.tf** file.
* **Change vpc_id** to any VPC in ca-central-1 (Ex: vpc-0e608033e14b01c3c)
* **Change subnet id** - use available subnets from AZ **a or b**. (Ex: subnet-086dd80df2e64b56b)

Save it

Now, Create a key pair. The same public key will be saved into the EC2 being launched.
```
ssh-keygen -f mykey
```
```
terraform init
```
```
terraform fmt
```
```
terraform validate
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
**Note:** 
* If it is showing any **Error** for **Security group / KeyPair**, It means that they are already existing, delete the Keypair/Security Group in Console or Rename it in **variable.tf** file.

Once the resources are created. Then, verify all the resources and then destroy them.
```
terraform destroy
```

## Frequently used Terraform Commands with Explanation
1. terraform version

**Explanation:** This command displays the version of Terraform currently installed on your system. It's a quick way to check the installed version and make sure it matches the version you intend to use.
```
terraform version
```
2. terraform init

**Explanation:** This command initializes and Prepares your working directory. It downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend configuration defined in your terraform block.
```
terraform init
```
3. terraform providers

**Explanation:** This command shows a list of installed provider plugins along with their versions. Providers are responsible for managing resources on various cloud platforms.
```
terraform providers
```
4. terraform fmt

**Explanation:** This command automatically formats your Terraform configuration files to follow a consistent style. It helps in maintaining a clean and readable codebase.
```
terraform fmt
```
5. terraform validate

**Explanation:** This command validates the syntax and structure of your Terraform configuration files. It checks for any errors or issues in your code.
```
terraform validate
```
6. terraform plan

**Explanation:** This command generates an execution plan. It compares the current state of your infrastructure with the desired state defined in your Terraform files. It shows you what changes Terraform will make to achieve the desired state without actually making those changes.
```
terraform plan
```
7. terraform apply

**Explanation:** This command applies the changes defined in your Terraform configuration to the infrastructure. It creates, updates, or deletes resources as necessary to match the desired state.
```
terraform apply
```
8. terraform output

**Explanation:** This command displays the values of **output variables** defined in your Terraform configuration. Output variables provide information about the resources created or managed by Terraform.
```
terraform output
```
9. terraform show

**Explanation:** This command displays the current state of your infrastructure as recorded in the Terraform state file. It provides a human-readable representation of the resources that Terraform is managing, along with their attributes and current values.
```
terraform show
```
10. terraform get

**Explanation:** This command is used to download and update the modules specified in your configuration. Modules are reusable components that encapsulate infrastructure resources and their configurations.
```
terraform get
```
11. terraform destroy

**Explanation:** This command is used to destroy the infrastructure defined in your Terraform configuration. It deletes all the resources that were created using Terraform.
```
terraform destroy
```
12. terraform import

**Explanation:** The terraform import command allows you to import existing infrastructure resources into your Terraform state. This is useful when you have resources that were not initially created and managed by Terraform, but you want to start managing them using Terraform moving forward.
```
terraform import
```
13. terraform refresh

**Example:** Let's say you have an AWS EC2 instance defined in your configuration. If someone manually stops or starts the instance using the AWS Management Console, Terraform wouldn't be aware of this change until you run terraform refresh. Once you do, Terraform will update its state to match the current status of the instance.
```
terraform refresh
```
14. terraform login

**Explanation:** This command is used to obtain and save credentials for a remote host, typically used with remote backends.
```
terraform login
```
15. terraform logout

**Explanation:** This command removes locally-stored credentials for a remote host.
```
terraform logout
```
16. terraform taint

*terraform taint aws_instance.example*

**Explanation:** This command marks a resource instance as not fully functional. It's used to indicate that a resource has issues and needs to be recreated.
```
terraform taint
```
17. terraform untaint

*terraform untaint aws_instance.example*

**Explanation:** This command removes the 'tainted' state from a resource instance, indicating that the resource is now functional.
```
terraform untaint
```
18. terraform workspace

*terraform workspace new dev* (This would create a new workspace named "dev.")

**Explanation:** This category of commands is used for workspace management. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (such as development, staging, and production) within the same configuration.
```
terraform workspace
```
